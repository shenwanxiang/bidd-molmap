The pharmacokinetics of levorphanol have been studied in a limited number of cancer patients following intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) and oral (PO) administration. Following IV administration, plasma concentrations of levorphanol decline in a triexponential manner with a terminal half-life of approximately 11 to 16 hours and a clearance of 0.78 to 1.1 L/kg/hr. Based on terminal half-life, steady-state plasma concentrations should be achieved by the third day of dosing. Levorphanol is rapidly distributed (<1 hr) and redistributed (1 to 2 hours) following IV administration and has a steady-state volume of distribution of 10 to 13 L/kg.

single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and
25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less
than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites
has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice
daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to
33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours.",1984,427.54,7,2,74.3,9,neutral,2.3,2.2

Metabolism: Latanoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active acid. The active acid of latanoprost reaching the systemic circulation is primarily metabolized by the liver to the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor metabolites via fatty acid β-oxidation.. Excretion: The elimination of the acid of latanoprost from human plasma is rapid (t1/2=17 min) after both intravenous and topical administration. Systemic clearance is approximately 7 mL/min/kg. Following hepatic β-oxidation, the metabolites are mainly eliminated via the kidneys.

The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state following a single intravenous dose of linagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 L, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75%-89% at ≥30 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin.

The in vitro protein binding of nintedanib in human plasma was high, with a bound fraction of 97.8%. Serum albumin is considered to be the major binding protein. Nintedanib is preferentially distributed in plasma with a blood to plasma ratio of 0.87.
Elimination: The effective half-life of nintedanib in patients with IPF was 9.5 hours (gCV 31.9%). Total plasma clearance after intravenous infusion was high (CL: 1390 mL/min; gCV 28.8%).

There were no differences in VX-710 pharmacokinetic parameter values between the VX-710 single-agent infusion cycle and the combination therapy cycle (VX-710–doxorubicin), as shown in Fig 3, where selected pharmacokinetic parameters of VX-710 from all patients were plotted by cohorts. VX-710 has linear pharmacokinetics as indicated by the lack of dose dependence in CLs and Vss. In lieu of the observed linear pharmacokinetics, Table 6 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters of VX-710 for the combined data from all dose groups and both treatment phases, except for Css, which was proportional to dose and hence summarized by dose cohorts.",,1994,603.71,10,0,117.1,16,neutral,5.4,5.4
